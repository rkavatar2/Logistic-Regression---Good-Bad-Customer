# Logistic-Regression---Good-Bad-Customer
Building a logistic regression model using R

This is a direct marketing dataset and this dataset is from a direct marketer who sells his products only via direct mail. 
He sends catalogues with product characteristics to customers who then order directly from the catalogues. 
The marketer has developed customer records to learn what makes some customers spend more than others. 
The dataset has one thousand customer records with information on the age of customers categorised as old, middle and young customers. 
Information on the gender of customers as males and females, information about whether the customers own a house or not own a house, are they single or married, 
how far do the customers live away from the Brick and Mortar stores that sell the similar kind of products that this direct marketer also sells. 
The salary of the people or the customers, how many children they have ranging from zero to three, what has been their past history in terms of volume 
of purchase and how many catalogues this direct marketer has sent to these customers. We also have information about the amount spent by each of these customers. 
What we want to do is, we want to build a logistic regression model which would predict good or bad customer based on these attributes.
